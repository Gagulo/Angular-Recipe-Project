# RecipeProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.1.
As an Back-end I'm using a Firebase.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Recipe / Ingredient App

This app is not mine, I'm simply coding along with Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller the Udemy expert.
